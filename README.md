<H1>Image Segmentation Using Clustering</H1>
<hr>
<p>In image segmentation using clustering, we use clustering algorithms like K-means to divide an image into meaningful segments. Each segment corresponds to a group of pixels that share similar characteristics, typically color or intensity. The goal is to simplify an image by grouping similar pixels together, often based on color, to make it easier to identify regions of interest.</p>
<h3>How it Works:</h3>
<p>Data Preparation: First, the image is converted into a list of pixels, where each pixel is represented by its RGB (or grayscale) values. This reshapes the image into a format that clustering algorithms can process.

Applying Clustering: The clustering algorithm, like K-means, groups similar pixels together. Each group (or "cluster") has a centroid, which represents the average color of that cluster. For instance, if we set K=3, the algorithm will find three dominant colors in the image and assign each pixel to the closest color.

Reconstructing the Segmented Image: After clustering, the image is reconstructed by replacing each pixel with the color of its assigned cluster centroid. This creates an effect where each segment of the image shows a uniform color, highlighting different regions.</p>
<h3>Applications</h3>
<p>This technique is useful for color-based segmentation, such as separating objects in an image, simplifying images for analysis, or extracting regions of interest. It's commonly used in medical imaging, object detection, and scene understanding.</p>
